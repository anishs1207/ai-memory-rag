many llm debate on an issue and then make an action for it

MANY WORKERS VOTE OTHER LLMS to be

THOUGHT EXPERIMENT:

- get 50 diff personaas of people (diff system prompts taken)
- deploy 50 instances of llm (can with their own voice & option to make cohocues)
- first voice is to contest in election or not contest in elections
- and then let each llm convince the oether why it should be votes wrt its erpsonna
- and then choose a panel of 5 llms to make a final descion based on votes (all are equal)
- and then llm generates diff screnerios to vote in and see its impract
- and then see option to revote if manouirty of people choose revote then revote & it repaters agai
